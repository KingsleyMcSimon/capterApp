# About The Project:

This project is all about building a web application that looks like the popular social media application called twitter. But i called it Capter. It has some basic functionality of the original twitter where a new user can sign up, an existing user can sign in and send a tweet or what i called a capt. A user can not see a conversation except if he or she signs in. Auser can as well edit a conversation, edit it or have it deleted.

# Built With:

Ruby On Rails, Bulma - a CSS framework.

# Getting Started With The Project:

1. You need to have a computer with a good operating system

2. Any code editor can serve but i preferred using VSCode.

3. The will and determination to learn how to write codes.

4. Create a new rails project by using the command: 'rails new (the name of your would be app)'.

5. Add some gems like: gem 'better_errors', gem 'guard', gem 'guard-livereload', gem 'web-console', gem 'bulma-rails', gem 'devise', gem 'gravatar_image_tag', gem 'simple_form' from [RubyGemsSite](https://rubygems.org) to get the latest version of the gem, 'save' and run 'bundle install' to install the gem.

6. Ensure you bring up your rails application using 'rails server' and run 'rails generate scaffold (and the model you want to use, in my case i used Capt capt:text)' and then ran the 'rails db:migrate' command later to get started with the project.

7. Install other necesary things that are needed for the project.

8. Add and commit your changes using your version control system known as git by running 'git init', then consolidate it with your consolidation system using either Github or Gitbucket, adding the remote repsitory you have created locally.
